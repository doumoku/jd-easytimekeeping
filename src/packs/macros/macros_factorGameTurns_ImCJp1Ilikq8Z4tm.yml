  factorGameTurns is where the API calls start to get a little more complex.


  This function takes an integer representing the total number of minutes
  elapsed since midnight on day 0

  and factors it into a gameTurnTime object, representing the number of game
  turns, shifts, days, weeks, the named

  shift and more for the given time. The most common way to obtain the total
  elapsed minutes is from a timeAugmented object returned from the API functions
  set, increment, & getTime.


  The timeAugmented object doesn't contain this data already because it requires
  additional calculations but the

  information isn't always required.


  See:

    - https://github.com/DC23/jd-easytimekeeping/blob/main/documentation/timekeeper.md#gameturntime

  // For this example, let's set the time to 7pm on day 3, and store the return
  value 

  const timeData = game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.set({days:3,
  hours:19})


  // The return value has both the previous time and the newly set time.

  // Have a look in the console

  console.log(timeData)


  const factored =
  game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.factorGameTurns(timeData.time.totalMinutes)

  console.log(factored)


  // turns and shifts are 0-based

  // This example shows where you can get the name of the day as well, as set by
  the module settings

  // It's not a great message, but the idea is that the API gives you the tools
  to build your own things.

  const message = `It's turn ${factored.turns + 1} in shift ${factored.shifts +
  1}. It is ${factored.shiftName} on ${timeData.time.day.name}.`
