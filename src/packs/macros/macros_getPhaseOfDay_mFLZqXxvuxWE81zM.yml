  /*

  Get the name of the current phase of the day as a localised string.


  Not to be confused with the four shifts, the phase of day relates

  to the daylight cycle. During the day phase, the scene lighting

  will be set to the day value. During the night, scene lighting is

  set to the night value. During dawn, lighting is gradually changed

  from the night to the day values, while during dusk, the lighting

  changes from the day to night values.


  The exact time at which dawn, day, dusk, and night occur depend on the world
  settings.
