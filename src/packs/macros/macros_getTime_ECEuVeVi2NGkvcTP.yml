  The API has several functions for getting the time. 


  getTime is the most fundamental. It returns a timeAugmented object, described
  in the API documentation.

  See:
  https://github.com/DC23/jd-easytimekeeping/blob/main/documentation/timekeeper.md#timeaugmented


  This function is mostly useful if you need to do time calculations, or have
  very specific formatting needs.

  If you just want the time as a formatted string, then see the toTimeString
  function.

  const time = game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.getTime()


  // time is a data object

  console.log(time)


  // You can use it to build formatted strings or do calculations

  // If you are unsure which values are 0-based or 1-based, see the API
  documentation

  const message = `It's hour ${time.hours} of ${time.day.name} of week
  ${time.weekNumber}`
