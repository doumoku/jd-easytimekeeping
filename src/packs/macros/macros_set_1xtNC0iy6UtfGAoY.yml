  /*

  The set function will set the time to a specific value.

  Internally, it's used by the reset and set time dialogs.


  It takes the same time object (see the API documentation on GitHub) as 

  increment, accepting values in days, hours, and minutes.

  These values are 0-based, and {days:0, hours:0, minutes:0} is

  12:00 midnight on day 0. This is the default value, so calling set

  with no argument will reset the time.


  Note that while the UI displays time in weeks, the set function doesn't accept
  input in weeks. If you want to set time in weeks, you would use the API
  constants daysPerWeek value to calculate the required number of days. I'll
  keep that for a more advanced example.

  */


  /* Set the time to 8:48pm on day 7

  Note that days, hours, and minutes are 0-based. Sunday is day 6, but the UI
  will display it as day 7 of week 1. 8pm is 20:00 in 24-hour time but that is
  0-based, since 12am is 00:00 - that's the zero.


  If you have the UI options enabled that display the time in game turns, then
  the number of turns this time works out to will depend on how long you set a
  turn for. But it will always be 8:48pm in the evening shift on Sunday of week
  1.
